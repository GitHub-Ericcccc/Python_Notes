11.1 Regular Expressions

see python documentation

import re 
re.search()
if a string matches a regular expression
similar to using the find() method for strings

re.findall() 
extract portions of a string that match the re
similar to a combination of find(0 and slicing: var[5:10]

hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if line.find('From: ') >=0:
		print(line)

import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if re.search('From: ', line): #library.function, pass in the line and the string, return true or false
		print(line)

---
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if line.startswith('From: ') >=0:
		print(line)

import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if re.search('^From: ', line): #add the ^ to specify the start character
		print(line)

Wild-Card Characters
dot . matches any character
asterisk * means any number of times

eg. ^X.*:
this will get strings start with X, having any characters then followed a colon:

X-Sieve: CMU Sieve 2.3
X-DSPAM-Result: Innocent
X=DSPAN-Confidence: 0.8475
X-Content-Type-Message-Body: text/plain
X-Plane is behind schedule: two weeks

eg. ^X-\S+:
start of the line is X-
match any non-whitespace character \s
one or more times +
followed by a colon:

Therefore X-Plane is behind schedule: two weeks is NOT chosen by this re

11.2 Extracting Data

[] is a single character
eg. [0-9]+ means one or more digits

import re
x = 'My 2 favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
y = re.findall('[0-9]+', x)
print(y)
 
just like a split and for-loop
you will get the list ['2', '19', '42']

---
y = re.findall('[AEIOU]+', x)
print(y)

get an empty list []

---
What is Greedy Matching
The repeat characters (* and +) push outward in both directions (greedy) to match the largest possible string.

eg. Greedy Matching

import re
x = 'From: Using the : character'
y = re.findall('^F.+', x)
print(y)

Return:
['From: Using the :']
Notice that it is greedy so that it does not return ['From:']

---
Non-Greedy Matching
prefers the shortest string that matches re

eg.
import re
x = 'From: Using the : character'
y = re.findall('^F.+?', x)
print(y)

Return:
['From:']

eg. Looking for email addresses

x = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('\s+@\s+', x)
print(y)

Return:
['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za']

Note: if non-greedy, the Return will be ['d@u']

---
Fine-tuning String Extraction
Parentheses are not part of the match - but they tell where to start and stop what string to extract

x = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('From (\s+@\s+)', x)
print(y)

Return:
['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za'] #The result seems the same

---
eg. Extracting a host name using find and string slicing

data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
atpos = data.find('@')
sppos = data.find(' ', atpos)
host = data[atpos+1. sppos]
print(host)

Return:
21
31
uct.ac.za

---
Using dual split pattern

words = data.split()
email = words[1]
pieces = email.split('@')
print(piesec[1])

Return:
['From', 'stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za', 'Sat', 'Jan', '5', '09:14:16', '2008']
'stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za'
['stephen.marquard', 'uct.ac.za']
'uct.ac.za'

---Using Regex
import re
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('@([^ ]*)', data)
print(y)

Return:
['uct.ac.za']

'@([^ ]*)'
@  look through the string until you find an at sign
() extract only inside the parentheses
[^ ] match non-blank character
^ means not
* match many times

---
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('^From .*@([^ ]*)', data)
print(y)

Return:
['utc.ac.za']

'^From .*@([^ ]*)'
^From starting at the beginning of the line, look for string 'From ' 
.*@  any number of characters up to an @
( begin extracting
[^ ]* any number of non-blank characters
) end extracting

Notice:
^ marks the beginning of a line
[^] marks a single character NOT in the listed set

So, if you if you didn't have a from line,
you would get nothing back,
and you're not finding email addresses in the middle of text,
you're just finding email addresses on lines that start with from space.

---
import re
hand = open('mbox-shor.txt')
numlist = list()
for line in hand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	stuff = re.findall('^X-DSSPAM-Confidence: ([0-9.]+)', line)
	if len(stuff) != 1:	continue # stuff is a list of extracted numbers with one floating number in each element
	num = float(stuff[0])	#Extract the number from the one-element list and get float from strings
	numlist.append(num)	#Add the number of this line to the list numlist
print('Maximum:', max(numlist))



Starting from X-DSSPAM-Confidence: 
Followed by a blank
Start to extract any times of numbers and dot.
with the dot. we can get floating numbers

---
Escape Character
prefix the character with backslash \
eg. \. \#

Question:
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('\S+?@\S+', data)
print(y)
