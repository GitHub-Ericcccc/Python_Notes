Course 4 Using database with python

Chapter 14

This course is more about database and Structured Query Language (SQL) than about python.

print(ord('H'))

print(ord('e'))

print(ord('\n'))

The ord() function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character.

Unicode is designed for extracting all possible characters.

When we talk to an external resource like a network socket we sends bytes, so we need to encode Python 3 strings into a given character encoding.
When we read data from an external resource, we must decode it based on the character set so it is properly represented in Python 3 as a string.

while True:
	data = mysock.recv(512)
	if (len(data) < 1):
		break
	mystring = data.decode() # by defalut, it use ascii or utf-8 to decode dynamically.
	print(mystring)

# decode goes from data(bytes) to string(unicode) VERY IMPORTANT!
# decode is a method in bytes-class
# encode is a method in string-class
# see documentation

14.1 Object Oriented Programming (VERY IMPORTANT)

An Object is a bit of self-contained Code and Data.
A Class is a template. (with data and code)
Method or Message is a defined capability of a class. (function lives in an object)
Field or Attribute is a bit of data in class.
Object or Instance is a particular instance of a class.
Constructor is code that runs when an object is created.
Inheritance is the ability to extend a class to make a new class.


use type(object) to find out its class.
use dir(object) to find out its methods.

14.2 Our First Class and Object

# 14.2

class PartyAnimal:
    x = 0

    def __init__(self):
        print('I am constructed.')

    def party(self):
        self.x = self.x + 1
        print('So far', self.x)

    def __del__(self):
              print('I amd destructed', self.x)

x = PartyAnimal()

x.party()
x.party()
x.party()
x = 546165 # reassign new value to x and destruct its class
print('x contains', x)

print(dir(PartyAnimal)) # Notice that there is 'party' and 'x' inside which defined by this class.


# What we are doing here is just like
# For example the class 'list'
# newlist = list()
# newlist.append('x')
# newlist.append('x')
# newlist.append('x')
# print(newlist)

# append is a method (inner function) of the object list
# the 'x' here is the data of the object list
# the newlist is an oject of class list


14.3 Object Life Cycle

Objects are created, used and discarded.
We have special blocks of code (methods) that get called:
	at the moment of creation - constructor, which is used a lot.
	at the moment of destruction - destructor, which is seldom used.

class PartyAnimal:
    x = 0
    name = ''
    def __init__(self, z):
        self.name = z
        print(self.name, 'constructed.')

    def party(self):
        self.x = self.x + 1
        print(self.name, 'party count', self.x)

s = PartyAnimal('sally')
s.party()

j = PartyAnimal('jim')
j.party()
s.party()

# This example works like this:
# s = {x=2, name = sally}
# j = (x=1, name = jim)
# s and j are two independent instances with their own name and x.
