# 15.4 - Designing a Data Model

Basic Rule: Don't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead.

When there is one thing in the 'real world' there should be one copy of that thing in the database.
	- A problem has to do with replicated data in columns, which may lead to inefficiency with large amount of data.
	- Distinguish wheather 'the thing' represents a 'real thing' in the world or just an attribute of others.

Example: Music Album

Track: the real thing
Rating, Len and Count: the attributes

Tracks belong to Album.
Album belongs to Artist.
Genre belongs to Track.

#15.5 - Representing a Data Model in Tables

A primary key is a way for us to refer to a particular row and it has a unique number.

Table Track:
id-primary key
title-logical key
rating
len
count
album_id-foreign key

Table Album:
id-primary key
title-logical key
artist_id-foreign key

Table Artist:
id-primary key
name-logical key

Table Genre:
id-primary key
name-logical key

Therefore, the album_id(foreign key) points to Primay Key in Table Album.
Primary Key is the ending point of the arrow.
Foreign Key is the starting point ot the arrow.
Foreign Key ---> Primary Key
Logical Key is the for looking up like shortcuts.You might use this for WHERE Caluse or ORDER BY Caluse.

Learn the name convention from where you work.


SQL

CREATE TABLE `Artist` (
	`id`	INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	`name`	TEXT
);

We tend to work outward in. The leaves ot this tree outward in.
Artist, Genre, Album then Track Table.
Because you need to create ends of the arrows before creating the beginnings of the arrows.

CREATE TABLE Genre(
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY autoincrement unique,
	name text
)

The next is Album Table, which is the first table to have a foreign key.

CREATE TABLE Album(
	id integer not null primary key autoincrement unique,
	artist_id integer,
	title text
)


CREATE TABLE Track(
	id integer not null primary key autoincrement unique,
	title TEXT,
	album_id integer,
	genre_id integer,
	len integer, rating integer, count integer
)


#15.6 - Inserting Relational Data

When we insert data to Artist Table, we don't need to specify id because it is autoincrement data.
The keywords of SQL, their cases do not matter. You can use INSERT or insert.

insert into Artist(name) values('Led Zepplin');
insert into Artist(name) values('AC/DC')

Notice that you need to put a semicolon; at the end of each command line to use multiple commands.

insert into Genre(name) Values('Rock');
insert into Genre(name) values('Metal')

insert into Album(title, artist_id) values('Who Made Who', 2);
insert into Album(title, artist_id) values('IV', 1)

Key Point! Take a close look at the two commands above.
You need to use the artist_id as numbers instead of using them directly by inputing strings.
You might need to remember them from Artist Table to make it correct.
Actually, we can use Python code to do this like 'insert Genre as Rock' then let python to get the right id number.

insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) 
     values ('Black Dog', 5, 297, 0, 2, 1);
insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id)
     values ('Stairway', 5, 482, 0, 2, 1);
insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) 
     values ('About to Rock', 5, 313, 0, 1, 2);
insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) 
     values ('Who Made Who', 5, 207, 0, 1, 2)

See this above code, it is OKAY to have replications as long as they are numbers. We should never see replications of strings!

If there's millions of them it's not just that it takes up storage, it's it has to do with how much has to be scanned.
So part of what you're trying to do in databases is reduce the amount of data that has to be scanned to get to a particular piece of information.

#15.7 - Reconstructing Data with JOIN

The JOIN Operation
It links across several tables as part of a select operation.
You must tell the JOIN how to use the keys that meake the connection between the ables using an ON clause.
This operation is used to show/output the user interface desired results rather than only many id numbers.

Example:
select Album.title, Artist.name from Album join Artist on Album.artist_id = Artist.id
select Album.title, Album.artist_id, Artist.id, Artist.name from Album join Artist on Album.artist_id = Artist.id
select Track.title, Genre.name from Track join Genre on Track.genre_id = Genre.id
select Track.title, Genre.name from Track join Genre

# notice that without the on clause, it will show all combinations of two sides, which is useless.
# On clause only picks the combinations that match, which is what we need.

select Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name from Track join Genre join Album join Artist
on Track.genre_id = Genre.id and Track.album_id = Album.id and Album.artist_id = Artist.id

# Worked Example: Tracks.py (Chapter 15)

After running the Tracks.py, you will get a sqlite3 file.
Open it then type the following commands.


select Track.title, Album.title, Artist.name from Track join Album join Artist on Track.album_id = Album.id and Album.artist_id = Artist.id

Therefore, we get a track list. We can use xml from iTunes library.
